Data compression continues to grow more important in the era of rapid communication and transfer of data. Compression algorithms allow this to happen, but there are many different options available for use. This comparative study investigates three different lossless compression algorithms, namely Zstandard, zlib, and LZ4. The study aims to provide insight into the performance of each algorithm to identify its strengths and weaknesses in different applications

### Benchmark

These algorithms claims to offer the same benefits, however, each algorithm will have its own strengths and weaknesses. This project aims to discover what they are by testing each algorithm with the same corpus and specifications. The following benchmarks will be measured and compared:
- Compression Ratio
- Compression Speed
- Decompression Speed
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
