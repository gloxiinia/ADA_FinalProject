# Project Details
This project is a comparative study of different data compression algorithms, namely:
- Zstandard
- zlib
- LZ4

These algorithms claims to offer the same benefits, however, each algorithm will have its own strengths and weaknesses. This project aims to discover what they are by testing each algorithm with the same corpus and specifications. The following benchmarks will be measured and compared:
- Compression Ratio
- Compression Speed
- Decompression Speed
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
